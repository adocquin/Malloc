# Malloc

The goal of this project was to recode malloc, realloc and free functions in C. It was a 2nd year project at Epitech.

The library can be build with the command "make re", it became libmy_malloc.so.

To launch a program with the custom malloc you can use "./load_malloc.sh <program_name>" or directly "./load_malloc.sh main.out" to test it.
